Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Boaz, and I am currently learning Git and GitHub to improve my version control and development workflow. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building skills that will help me in future projects and opportunities.

In my free time, I like experimenting with automation, coding, and solving technical problems. This course has been a great opportunity to understand how real-world collaboration works with Git and GitHub.
